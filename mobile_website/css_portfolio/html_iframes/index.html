            Remember Neopets? If you don't, you should. This website, circa 1999, was like the OG smartphone community open-world type game. Users owned virtual pets, played games, earned virtual currency, and used that currency to purchase virtual items for their pets. I firmly believe it's time to bring it back. IT'S STILL ACTIVE.
