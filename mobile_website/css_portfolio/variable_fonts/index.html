            <h4>Typography</h4>
            <p>Typography is everywhere we look. It's in the books we read, on the websites we visit, even in everyday life—on street signs, bumper stickers, and product packaging.

            <p>But what exactly is typography? Simply put, typography is the style or appearance of text. It can also refer to the art of working with text—something you probably do all the time if you create documents or other projects for work, school, or yourself.</p>
            
            <h4>Common types of fonts</h4>
                
            <p>Typography can be an intimidating subject, but it doesn't have to be. You only need to know a little to make a big difference in the stuff you do every day. So let's get started. First, some common types of fonts and what you need to know about them.</p>
            
            <h4>Serif fonts</h4>
                
            <p>Serif fonts have little strokes called serifs attached to the main part of the letter.
            </p>
                
            <p>Because of their classic look, they're a good choice for more traditional projects. They're also common in print publications, like magazines and newspapers.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Sans serif fonts</h4>
            
            <p>Sans serif fonts don't have that extra stroke—hence the name, which is French for without serif.
            </p>   
        
            <p>This style is considered more clean and modern than serif fonts. Also, it tends to be easier to read on computer screens, including smartphones and tablets.</p>             

            <h4>Display fonts</h4>  
            
            <p>Display fonts come in many different styles, like script, blackletter, all caps, and just plain fancy.</p>  
                
            <p>Because of their decorative nature, display fonts are best for small amounts of text, like titles and headers and more graphic-heavy designs.</p>
