    <h1>The Internet: What does it meme?</h1>
    <h2>Making the future both more and less connected</h2>
    <p>Let me preface this review by reminding you that I am actively using the internet to do so. With that said, I am of two minds about this "The Internet." 
 <p>On one hand, accessibility and interconnectedness breed innovation and understanding. The more access we have to information that educates and challenges our world view, the more likely we are to grow. Marginalized humans living in homogenous communities are able to see that they are not alone. We are able to readily access news and information about the world outside our own narrow experience. </p>  
    <p>On the other hand, The Internet is also a mask for the faces of those who spew hateful rhetoric. It allows ignorance to blossom and grow as hate begets hate, and those who would have otherness stomped out are able to find like-minded individuals who stoke the flames of their bigotry.
 </p>
 <p>Overall, my review of the internet is mostly positive. With any communication, there is room for both growth and its inverse  outcomes. Generally, I believe more good than bad has come of it.

 <p>The Internet gets Two Thumbs: One up, one down.</p>
