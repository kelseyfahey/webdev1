            <p>There are many ways to include links in webpages. Below are just a few examples.</p>

            <p><b>Inline links</b>
            <br>
            An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.
            <br>    
            An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview, cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing software – e.g., with an external link. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a page layout. </p>

            <p><b>Fat link</b><br>
                A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link" or a "multi-tailed link") is a hyperlink which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a multivalued function. </p>

            <a id="atags"><b>Anchor</b></a>
            <br>
            An anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document—generally text, though not necessarily. For instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a political map of Africa may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.
