            <p>In Steven Universe, the world is protected from evil threats by the Crystal Gems, a movement of Gems sworn to protect the Earth from the Homeworld Gems. Their powers flow from their gemstones; magical gems embedded somewhere on the host's body. The four Crystal Gems are Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl, and Steven. Multiple gems, such as Peridot, Lapis Lazuli, Bismuth and a human, Connie Maheswaran has also joined the team. Steven is a young half-human, half-gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, a Crystal Gem named Rose Quartz, who gave up her form to create Steven. As Steven tries to figure out the secrets to using his gem, he spends his days in Beach City doing activities with the other Crystal Gems, whether it's helping them save the universe or just hanging out. </p>
